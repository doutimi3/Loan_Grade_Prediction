# LOAN GRADE PREDICTION TASK

# INTRODUCTION
Loan grading is an aspect of the credit screening and approval processes that is
part of a lending institution's loan review or credit risk system. Loan grading is a
categorization method that assigns a ranking or a designation to a loan based on
the borrower's credit history, the quality of the collateral, and the possibility of
principal and interest payments. Predicting the grade of a loan is an important
activity conducted by lending institutions to determine the risk associated with a
loan and the likelihood of repayment. This project explores the use of machine
learning techniques in automating the process of loan grading.

# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project is to carry out a detail exploratory data analysis and
develop a predictive model to predict loan grades based on the information
available before a loan is approved. This will be achieved by comparing the performance of different 
models to ascertain the best performing model
